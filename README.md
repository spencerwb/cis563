# Material Point Method Simulation

C++ Material Point Method Elasticity Simulation.

To compile, you will need the Eigen Linear Algebra Library installed on your computer. All compilation was performed on a Linux system.

Run "make" in the command line in the directory:
"cis563/Projects/mass_spring"

Then to run the executable produced from compiling and linking, run "./mass_spring 3" in the same directory.

The .poly files will be saved in the output folder. The produced poly files can be visualized in teh Houdini viewport using the Houdini
file called mpm_render.hipnc in the rendering folder.
